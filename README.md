Creative Therapy Database (CTDB)

The purpose of this website is to create a space for physical and occupational therapists to join creative forces and improve their practice. Users can search through a database of therapeutic activites by equipment required, and there will be links to where you can buy the products. After the user creates an account they can submit to add a new activity idea, they will have a favorites list so that they will be able to easily find an idea that they want to try.
